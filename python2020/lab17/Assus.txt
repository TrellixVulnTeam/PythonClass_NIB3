your mother’s teeth myself from the spittoon of the South Pacic!
Here, sir, here are some of their fellows! ing these very teeth
into her tortoiseshell soup tureen & that, sir, that will grant me my
satisfaction! The twittering wits will scald the icy Marchioness in
their news sheets & by next season she shall be fortunate to receive

In haste, I bade Henry Goose a good day. I fancy he is a
Bedlamite.
Friday, 8th November—
In the rude shipyard beneath my window, work progresses on the
jibboom, under Mr. Sykes’s directorship. Mr. Walker, Ocean Bay’s
sole taverner, is also its principal timber merchant & he brags of his
years as a master shipbuilder in Liverpool. (I am now versed enough
in Antipodese etiquette to let such unlikely truths lie.) Mr. Sykes

I met Dr. Goose on the stairs this morning & we took breakfast

latitude east of Sydney & west of Valparaiso. I may even compose
